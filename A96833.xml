            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y dear and good friend, theſe Papers come now to your hands, to give you aſſurance, that my many late diſcourſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubjects here trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, were in good earneſt. What ever it was that occaſioned the forming of my conceptions into this ſhape, there is nothing in the world hath had a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er hand (if ſo it may be ſaid of motives) to give them birth, than your Paſſionate oppoſition. For I am weary of thoſe debates by word of mouth, wherein men of much zeal and prejudice grow ſo hot and ſo far tranſported, that inſtead of ſolid arguments advancing orderly under the command of ſober Reaſon,
<pb facs="tcp:116030:4"/> they can <hi>Levy</hi> no other forces but froath and choler to aſſiſt them. That I may no more break the peace (in this kinde) with you, nor indanger making the leaſt flaw in that dear friendſhip, that hath by ſo long a converſation grown up to ſo great a height betwixt us; I have reſolved to take this calmer courſe, to give an account of ſome grounds of my preſent perſwaſions, wherein I dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from your judgment. Perhaps they may ſometime or other finde your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſo quiet, your underſtanding ſo well awakened, and your Will ſo Willing to ſtand <hi>neuter,</hi> till theſe truths have a fair and full hearing, that they may make a better impreſſion than hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they have had opportunity to do, upon you. And becauſe I remember (in ſome heat of diſpute) you have thrown ſome things upon me, (which were not ſo much faults in me, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and ſcandals taken up by your ſelf) I ſhall briefly wipe them off, that ſuch rubs being removed out of your way, you may have the leſs objection to fright you from a further inquiry into the Articles under queſtion.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:116030:4"/>
                  <p> And now, I beſeech you, in the firſt place, to upbraid me no more with the errours of my education (for ſo I muſt now account them;) becauſe the greater the prejudices were which were inſtil'd into me againſt theſe doctrines, the greater you ought to conclude the light to be, which hath wrought this my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conviction of their truth, and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me to imbrace them, (againſt all the charmes of intereſt, and ſecular ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, wherewith the world tempts us, to the contrary.)</p>
                  <p>Unconſtancy (one of your other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges) I confeſs is ſometimes Culpable: but may we not ſay ſo too of Conſtancy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times; which is therefore reſembled (ſomwhere) to a fullen Porter, who keeps out better company oftentimes than he lets in? Our happineſs that will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable commenceth in a change; and 'tis our duty to turn from <hi>darkneſs to light,</hi> though we be called inconſtant for it. We were not born with our eyes open; neither ſhall we ever ſee far, if we look no further than that proſpect, which ſome few admired writers have
<pb facs="tcp:116030:5"/> ſet before us; The <hi>new man,</hi> which we are to <hi>put on,</hi> is <hi>renewed in knowledge</hi> &amp;. <hi>[Col.</hi> 3. 10.] If we receive our illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation regularly from heaven, that is given according to the capacity of the ſubject. We have a dawning firſt, but the progreſs of our light holds a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the ſedulity of our ſtudies. We are never too old to learn in Chriſt's School. But the great ſcandal, you ſay, is, to profeſs my ſelf a diſciple to ſuch Maſters. What Maſters do you mean? I call no man Maſter on Earth (in this ſenſe) nor ever will give any ſo great a dominion over my faith, as to ſwear allegiance to his doctrines. (I would others were as free from this yoak of bondage.) But yet I know 'tis not only a thing commendable, but a duty to march after the ſtandard of truth what hand ſoever carries it before us. And who do you think were the bearers of it? If you enquire into their learning, (even their adverſaries being Judges) they were as lights ſhining in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe nation, <hi>[Phil.</hi> 2. 15.] and if you examine their lives, for
<pb facs="tcp:116030:5"/> piety and juſtice, they were blameleſs and harmleſs as becomes the ſons of God, not more polite in their intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals than unreproveable in their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, but very eminent in both. And they have declared their virtues as well in a way of Paſſive obedience as Active. What profeſſors were ever more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and cheerful in their ſufferings for the word of God and for the teſtimony which they held (having been taught it (according to <hi>their</hi> full perſwaſion) as the truth is in Jeſus. <hi>[Epheſ.</hi> 4. 21.] They have been baniſhed, impriſoned, &amp;c.

For it is obſerved, that he changed his Batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as he changed his enemies, and imployed other principles againſt the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> than thoſe he uſed in comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Manichees,</hi> and from the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of his opinions in theſe points it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, that his followers expreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch different terms, that though taught in the ſame Sclool, and of the ſame maſter, yet they ſeem (as he ſaith) not to have learnt the ſame leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

                     <p>That you may not think I have a deſire to wave your queſtion, by telling you, that I perceive, you do, many times, alledge Scriptures very impertinently; I ſhall ſhape my anſwer directly, to what I conceive to be your meaning: we muſt conſider therefore what our Saviour Chriſt ſaith (very applicable to our purpoſe) <hi>S.</hi> Luke 17. 20. <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God</hi> (in the work we ſpeak of) <hi>cometh not</hi> (alwayes) <hi>with obſervation:</hi> but (many times) 'tis <hi>as if a man ſhould caſt ſeed into the ground, and ſhould ſleep, and riſe night and day, and the ſeed ſhould ſpring, and grow up, he knoweth not how. Mar.</hi> 4. 26, 27. And therefore I obſerve, our Saviour and Apoſtle do direct us to make our judgement <hi>à Foſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> from the effects. <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them.</hi> And <hi>let every man prove his own work, and then ſhall he have rejoycing in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alone and not in another,</hi> Gal. 6. 4. The children of God are called <hi>Saints of light.</hi> Col. 1. and the wiſeman ſaith, <hi>The path of the juſt is like the ſhining light that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day. Prov.</hi> 4. 18. 'Tis only the conſcience loaden with guilt, and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:116030:20"/> fear, and horrour, having fire put to it, that like a gun charged with powder and ſhot, makes a <hi>bounce</hi> when 'tis diſcharged. Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teacheth, that the natural day breaks without a crack to report it to us, and ſo does the day of grace too in many ſouls. Though the ſun riſeth under a cloud, and ſo undiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibly, and the clock of conſcience do not ſtrike to give us notice of the hour, yet we may be aſſured he is up by the effects, <hi>viz.</hi> if his influences have dried up the dirt and made the plants and herbs to ſpring out and flouriſh. <hi>Grace is more diſcoverable in the progreſs then in the dawning of it.</hi>

                     <p>That I may not deceive my ſelf nor you herein, I think the ſureſt way is, not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116030:21"/> to go by the common <hi>Inventory</hi> of the world; whereby I finde men pretending to godlineſs, to be generally very partial in their reckoning: if they <hi>abhor Idols,</hi> they think it tolerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <hi>to commit ſacriledge and ſedition:</hi> and if they be not drunk <hi>with wine, or ſtrong drink,</hi> they think 'tis no matter though the ſpirit of <hi>pride and diſobedience</hi> ſtagger them into any ſchiſme or hereſie. I chooſe therefore to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Apoſtles Catalogue, (and if I can find that in my ſelf, I hope I am ſafe) <hi>the fruit of the ſpirit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is love, joy, peace, long-Suffering, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, temperance: againſt ſuch there is no law.</hi> Gal. 5. 22, 23. That is (as I conceive) <hi>the love of Chriſt in ſinceritie,</hi> as 'tis <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6. 24. which ſinceritie diſcovers and approves itſelf, in a conſtant and uniform obſervation of all his Commandements. <hi>Iohn</hi> 14. 15.</p>

                     <p>How did the ſpirit of God bring forth theſe fruits in you (if you finde them?) Did you ever feel it offer a holy violence to your will and affections, ſo that you were not able to reſiſt the power of it? You have read how <hi>Paul</hi> was ſurprized in the height of his rebellion, his ſpirit ſubdued and forced to yield, and he caſt down to the earth in great aſtoniſhment.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116030:21"/> adde, that the converſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was not according to the common way and rule, but extraordinary, in regard whereof he may very well ſtile himſelf an <hi>abortive.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 8. for the ordinary courſe is not for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven to <hi>offer violence</hi> to us, and <hi>take us by force;</hi> but for us to do ſo by it.

                     <p>You ſpeak as if the grace of converſion were <hi>reſiſtible;</hi> and ſo you would make man ſtronger than God: but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells you, that God exerts and putteth forth a power for the converſion of a ſinner <hi>equal to that, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead. Epheſ.</hi> 1. 20. And indeed there is a neceſsitie of ſuch a power for the accompliſhment of this work; becauſe the ſinner is as a dead perſon; <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Epheſ.</hi> 2. 1.</p>

                     <p>Tis a rule we have learned in the ſchools, that <hi>Theologia Symbolica non eſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentativa.</hi> Metaphors never make ſolid and cogent arguments. Sinners are like dead men: but no like is the ſame. If they were abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely dead, then it were impoſsible for them to make any oppoſition or reſiſtance at all, to any the leaſt diſpenſation of grace. Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance implies reaction, but the dead have no power at all to act; and yet tis acknowledged; that the ſinner hath a power to reſiſt, and doth
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116030:22"/> actually reſiſt: but that which is maintained generally by that ſide is, that the power of grace is ſo prevalent and invincible, that at laſt it will ſubdue and take away the reſiſtibilitie of mans will. And therefore man is not dead in every ſenſe. We finde him ſometimes reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to one halfe dead. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 30. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to one aſleep. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 14. ſo that you cannot certainly infer the concluſion deſired, from ſuch figurative expreſſions. Beſides, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 20. ſpeaketh of Gods power towards thoſe that were already believers, not of his power that works belief in them.</p>

Wo unto thee <hi>Chorazin,</hi> wo unto thee <hi>Bethſaida:</hi> for if the mighty works which were done in you, had been done in <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> they would have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented</hi> long ago in ſackcloath and aſhes.

                     <p>This place in St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſpeaks of a charge given to a Miniſter, whoſe office it is, to call, invite, and importune, (to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that it is part of a parable) and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member even now, when you were urged with that in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 51. <hi>[ye alwayes reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt]</hi> then you could alledge, that, that was ſpoken concerning the outward miniſtery of the word, which you confeſt, might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted: but now you produce a text your ſelves, which though it doth moſt evidently belong to the outward miniſtery, yet becauſe it hath the word <hi>[compel]</hi> in it, and will ſerve your intereſt, it muſt needs ſignifie irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible. So that in the <hi>Acts,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt muſt (according to your interpretation) ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the outward Miniſtery, and that muſt be the only thing reſiſted: but in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> the outward Miniſtery ſhall ſignifie the inward working of the Holy Ghoſt, and that ſhall be irreſiſtible.</p>

And (3.) your text ſpeaks of a free disburſement of his <hi>favours:</hi> but our diſcourſe proceeds upon the account of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing men to ſin and puniſhment. Now I hope you will not call ſin Gods <hi>own</hi> (though your doctrin concludes him fairly to be the Author of it) and for puniſhment, he is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to call that, <hi>opus alienum,</hi> not his <hi>own,</hi> but a <hi>ſtrange work.</hi> But if your God, for his <hi>mere pleaſure only,</hi> and to make <hi>demonſtration</hi> of his <hi>abſolute power,</hi> hath appointed to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments, the greateſt part of his nobleſt Creatures <hi>without any reſpect to ſin,</hi> as ſome of your <hi>Synod</hi> do maintain (not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own image) in them, what is this but to play the tyrant, and where then is that <hi>infinite goodneſs,</hi> which you profeſs to be in your, and I expect to be in that God <hi>whom</hi> I fear and honour.

                     <p>A very uſeful diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and tending much to the honour of your God, as you have applied it.

There are ſins of commiſſion not capable of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction neither; as in blaſphemie, murder, adulterie, wherein the <hi>act</hi> is not to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the <hi>exorbitancie;</hi> were ſuch a diſtinction allowable before God, (and if it be not, ſure 'tis not to be alledged on his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half,) every tranſgreſſor might ſhew a fair acquittance, and juſtly plead [not guilty.] The Adulterer might ſay, he went in to his Adultereſs <hi>as a woman,</hi> not <hi>as ſhe was married to another man;</hi> and that he humbled her <hi>for procreation,</hi> or <hi>for a remedie of his Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcence,</hi> not <hi>for injurie to her husband;</hi> the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemer might ſay, what he ſpake was, <hi>to make uſe of the facultie of ſpeech,</hi> which God had given him, and <hi>to keep his tongue in ure,</hi> not <hi>to diſhonour the Almighty:</hi> and ſo (might every offender have leave by vertue of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to ſeparate his <hi>ſinful act</hi> from the <hi>enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of it)</hi> every ſin would become a miracle, that is, it would be an accident without a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

And you know it is not in my po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to procure a <hi>writ</hi> of <hi>Electment,</hi> to caſt out that ſin, which came in and keeps poſſeſſion by the uncontroulable order of the divine <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination.</hi> I cannot get grace when God will not give it me, nor keep it, when he is pleaſed to take it away from me. I have no <hi>Lure</hi> to throw out, that the <hi>Dove</hi> of Heaven will vouchſafe to ſtoop unto. <hi>the Spirit blows where he pleaſes, inſpires whom he pleaſes, and retires when he pleaſes; returns where he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> And ſo if it comes with an intent to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend me, it will be as impoſſible then to put him back, as it is now to draw him on.

                     <p>Sir, you are much mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken; indeed if a moral efficiencie would ſerve the turn, there are moſt excellent argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of perſwaſion to work upon a reaſonable Creature: but this is the very thing, that the <hi>Arminians</hi> do plead for. Our <hi>Synod</hi> and the <hi>Divines</hi> thereof teach us otherwiſe, namely, that the converſion of a ſinner cannot be wrought but by a phyſical or, or hyperphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal action, an impreſſion of grace that is <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible,</hi> to which effect the <hi>miniſtery</hi> of the word (as exhortations and commands, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threatnings) can no more avail (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no more aptitude thereunto) then to the <hi>raiſing of the dead,</hi> or the <hi>creation of the world.</hi>

                     <p>Alas Sir, you are as much out of the ſtory now as ever, for the <hi>grace</hi> of praier (without which the duty will be a vain oblation, if not abominable) muſt be derived from the ſame ſupernal fountain; and we cannot <hi>pump</hi> it up our ſelves, it comes freely; and when it comes, it is ſo impetuous, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows the ſoul with ſuch inundations of the ſpirit, that 'tis impoſſible to reſiſt it.

But Sir, you do well to take your leave of me; for it is evident, that God hath not imploy'd you, as intending my amendment by your miniſtery; ſince I find the confuſion of your doctrine, more apt to furniſh a <hi>cuſhion</hi> for the ſecure and areleſs, or a halter for the doubtfull and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, then any ſacred <hi>Amulet</hi> againſt the

                     <p>I did not expect ſuch a ſuppoſition, or objection from you of all men living; for to ſpeak properly, God is never angry but with the <hi>Reprobates,</hi> and I know 'tis your avowed opinion, that the <hi>Elect</hi> can neither fall <hi>finally,</hi> nor <hi>totally,</hi> and all the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodiſts</hi> are of the ſame judgement.

                     <p>I conceive, that ground is too looſe to bear the ſuperſtructure, the men of that opinion, would raiſe upon it; for they are not all ſaints in our Saviour's <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogie,</hi> neither did <hi>David</hi>'s ſin bereave him of the facultie of generation. The ſon of <hi>Jeſſe</hi> might have propagated a <hi>ſtem</hi> for the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to branch out of, and yet have died in his ſin afterwards; the impoſſibilitie therefore of his dying without repentance is grounded upon a more ſolid and impregnable foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>eternal decree</hi> and love of God, which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually concerns all the <hi>Elect.</hi> That immutable love wherein God elected them, doth exert it <hi>ſelf</hi> and prompt <hi>him</hi> infallibly to confer the grace of repentance upon them firſt or laſt, how great and how many ſins ſoever they run into.

Now all the promiſes of ſalvation in Chriſt, how univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſoever propounded, being (by your Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) reſtrained onely to theſe <hi>Elect,</hi> (amongſt whom that I ſhould reckon my ſelf, neither any particular mention of me in Scripture, nor any revelation by Angel or Prophet out of it, doth aſſure me) and the number of them (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your computation) being ſo <hi>ſmall</hi> in proportion to the <hi>Reprobates,</hi> there is ſo much odds againſt me, that I have reaſon to be afraid, that I am inliſted under the greater

                     <p>I confeſſe the <hi>judgement of Charitie</hi> is a try'd and equall <hi>beame</hi> in many Caſes, but if you extend it generally, and apply it unto all particulars, it muſt needs be very
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:116030:50"/> falſe; and I am confident, you dare not avouch the trueth of it in ſuch a latitude, or if you dare, you are no more able to maintaine it, than I can beleeve theſe two contrary propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at once, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> died for all, and yet, that he died for a very ſmall number. 2. It is not <hi>the judgement of my Charity,</hi> but the <hi>certaintie of my faith</hi> that muſt give me aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance and comfort in this particular. 3. <hi>Charitable judgement</hi> is a fair ſtandard to meaſure the doubtfull actions of our neighbour by, and commands us to cover his infirmities, and ſtifle the too light conception of ſuſpitions, and ſiniſter opinions touching him, but bindes us not to preach falſhood to him, to induce him (againſt his own reaſon) to foſter too good an opinion of himſelf. When I ſee a man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent himſelf to the Holy Sacrament, the <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Charity</hi> perſwades mee, (knowing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the contrary) that he addreſſes himſelf to it, with that preparation of heart, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a good Chriſtian. But that ſuch as are rightly prepared and qualified, do partake thereof to their ſalvation; this I beleeve by <hi>the judgement of faith,</hi> which adm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tteth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is or can be falſe. So when I ſee a ſick man render his ſoul up with much devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reſignation, into the hands of Chriſt, I <hi>beleeve charitably,</hi> that he dies as becomes a faithfull Chriſtian: But that God communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:116030:51"/> his ſalvation to ſuch as die in the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and obedience of the right faith; this I beleeve by the <hi>certainty of faith;</hi> wherein it is impoſſible I ſhould be deceived, though the judgment of Charity deceives us very often. In a word, the <hi>judgment of charity</hi> is a good ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meaſure betwixt man and man: but it is not current betwixt man and his own Conſcience, much leſſe betwixt him and God. I know, I am not to be relieved, but by ſuch ſuccours as are <hi>levied</hi> upon the divine promiſes, and thoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes having their foundation, and infallibilitie in the undeceivable truth of God, they require ſuch a certaintie of faith, as will admit no mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any thing falſe or doubtfull. Beſides, when I do inquire which act of faith hath the prioritie, <hi>viz. to beleeve in Chriſt, or to beleeve Christ to be my Saviour,</hi> (in particular) I am taught by ſome of your <hi>Divines (Maccovius</hi> by name,) that I muſt in the firſt place, beleeve <hi>that Christ is my Saviour,</hi> and that is the cauſe of the other <hi>act,</hi> or the reaſon why I <hi>place my faith in him.</hi> Now if Chriſt died only for a <hi>few</hi> particular perſons, and all the promiſes made in him, belong to thoſe <hi>few</hi> onely, unleſſe I could find ſome mention of my name amongſt them, or receive ſome <hi>revelation</hi> from heaven to that effect, how can I with any certainty or aſſurance build my faith upon it, that I am one of them?

This is ſtill your <hi>judgement of Charity;</hi> which though it ſuppreſſeth all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion in <hi>you</hi> towards me, yet can it not cure thoſe feares and jealouſies, which I have (but with too great reaſon) conceived of my ſelf. As for your appearances to the contrary, I cannot underſtand them, much leſſe ſet any value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; for by ſuch outward things, the <hi>Synod</hi> is ready to tell us, we can never perceive any thing of what belongs to the ſtate of <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Reprobation.</hi> I am beholding to you, that waving the ſeverity of your reaſon, you will make uſe of a charitable ſuppoſition to flatter me into an opinion, that I am one of that <hi>little Flock</hi> for which Chriſt dyed: But there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſecure and comfort me, but a full and certain perſwaſion that I am one of them; which you will never be able to work in me (denying that Chriſt died for all) unleſſe you can find ſome particular and undeniable evidence of my intereſt in him.</p>

                     <p>You ſhould reflect upon your former <hi>experience</hi> of God's gratious work in you.

                     <p>Some comfortable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions might be awakened and kindled in thoſe boſomes, that have been warmed with ſuch ſweet and heavenly experiences, if they were not all overcaſt and darkned again, by other black and diſmal clouds, which the obſervation of ſome of your greateſt <hi>Divines</hi> have ſpread over them. For Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (Inſtit. 1. 3. c. 2. §. 10, 11.) ſaith, <hi>The heart of man hath ſo many ſtarting holes, and ſecret corners, of vanitie and lying, and is cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with ſo many colours of guileful bypocriſie, that it oftentimes deceiveth it ſelf: and beſides experience ſheweth, that the Reprobates are ſometimes moved with the ſame feelings, that the Elect are, ſo that in their own judgement they nothing differ from the Elect.</hi> See <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. But the truth is, though I have lived a good moral life hitherto, and in a way of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty have had a comfortable dependence upon the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus, yet I am now affraid, I have had none of thoſe extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <hi>ſnavities</hi> and refreſhments of Gods ſpirit,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:116030:52"/> and conſequently have no aſſurance of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of that <hi>comforter,</hi> who is promiſed ſhall <hi>abide</hi> with us for ever.</p>

                     <p>It is applicable unto all; and every one, and grounded upon the unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable truth of the Holy Goſpel.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Tilenus Tentatus.</speaker>
                     <p>If it be applicable to all and every one, as you affirm, and grounded
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:116030:53"/> upon the truth; that is, as I conceive a rruth <hi>an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ecedent,</hi> to their believing; then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows undeniably that Chriſt died for all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and for every one in ſpeciall, (elſe how can the comfort of this doctrin be ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to them, as you would have it.) But if your meaning be, that, it will become true to me, or any other perſon <hi>[that Chriſt died for us,]</hi> by that <hi>Act</hi> of faith, which you would have me, or any ſuch other perſon give unto your ſpeeches; then you run into a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt abſurditie, maintaining, that the <hi>object</hi> of faith, or the thing propoſed to be believed, doth receive its <hi>truth,</hi> from the <hi>act</hi> of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and depend upon his conſent; whoſe faith and approbation can no more make true, that which in it ſelf is falſe, then make falſe by his unbelief, that which in it ſelf is true. Well may the <hi>Infidel</hi> deprive himſelf of the fruit of Chriſt's death, but he cannot bring to paſs, by his unbelief, that he hath not ſuffered it, as a proofe of his love to mankinde. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, the believer may receive benefit from the death of Chriſt, but his act of faith doth not effect, but neceſſarily ſuppoſe that death as ſuffered for him, before it can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed about it or lay hold upon it. Nay, my believing is ſo far from procuring Chriſts death for me, that on the contrary, our great Divines do maintain, <hi>quod nemo unquam fidem</hi>

                     <p>Sir, inſtead of lending me a clew to guide me out of that Maze of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties, into which the prodigious <hi>Divinity</hi> of the <hi>Synod</hi> hath led me, you intangle me much more in it. For whereas the Apoſtle ſaith, that <hi>God ſends ſtrong deluſions to ſuch as will not receive the love of the truth, that they may be ſaved.</hi> (2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.) You (governing your diſcourſe by thoſe principles) would firſt perſwade men to believe a falſe propoſition (when you exhort every man to believe that Chriſt died for him, which is falſe according to that <hi>Doctrin)</hi> and then having believed this falſhood, they are puniſhed by the ſpirit of errour to believe a lie. I beſeech you, which
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:116030:54"/> way would you have me turn my ſelf, to get out of theſe perplexities? Having inſtructed me to believe a doctrin, that turns my obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence into puniſhment, and makes my follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth (according to that Calculation) the ſure way to aggravate my damnation. For if the <hi>Synod</hi> ſaith true, and Chriſt be not dead, for them that believe not in him, how do they deſerve to be puniſhed, for not believing that which is falſe? And thoſe that do obey the Commandement and believe in his death (though but for a time,) why ſuffer they the puniſhment due only to the refractory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credulous, which is to believe a lie?</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Sir, you muſt not think to beguile us with your <hi>vain Philoſophie:</hi> we are too well eſtabliſhed in theſe ſaving truths, to be perverted by ſuch <hi>Sophiſtrie.</hi>

                     <p>If you have no better <hi>Cordials</hi> for afflicted Conſciences; nor firmer props to ſupport the neceſſitie of your miniſterie, than what the doctrins of the <hi>Synod</hi> will afford you, I am afraid, the moſt vulgar capacities will finde <hi>Logick</hi> enough to conclude, from the premiſes, that your office is altogether uſeleſs and impertinent. Laying aſide therefore the perſon of the <hi>Infidel, Carnal, Tepid,</hi> and <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted,</hi> whoſe parts I have hitherto acted, to make a practical trial of the efficacie of your miniſtery upon them, according to the tenour
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:116030:54"/> and conſequences of thoſe doctrins, I beſeech you ſadly to reflect upon what hath already paſs'd betwixt; and conſider further what a vertiginous ſpirit preſided in that <hi>Synod,</hi> that led thoſe <hi>Divines</hi> (Maugre all the reaſon to the contrary) to denie ſome things which the Scripture expreſly doth affirm; and to affirm other things, which the Scripture doth as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly denie. They denie <hi>the univerſalitie of the merits of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>death,</hi> (which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abundantly proclaimeth) and yet they do exhort and injoyn all men upon peril of damnation to believe in him; as if the <hi>Author</hi> of all truth did not only allow, but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſome men to believe falſhood. They exhort and command every one to believe <hi>that he is elected to ſalvation,</hi> (though indeed he be a very Reprobate,) and that he <hi>cannot loſe faith and grace</hi> once received, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in expreſs terms denieth. And as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of Chriſt's univerſal redemption, takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all the ſolid ground of comfort: ſo the aſſerting the Saint's indefectibilitie overthrows the neceſſitie of exhortation, with the uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of promiſes and threatnings to inforce it; for who will valew ſuch admonitions, <hi>[Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not your hearts, take heed leſt ye fall, receive not the grace of God in vain.]</hi> When he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed to believe, that he can never be ſo far wanting to the grace of God, nor harden
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:116030:55"/> his heart, nor fall from his ſtanding ſo far as to indanger his ſalvation, and who will denie himſelf (upon the aſſault of a gallant tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eſpecially) the preſent ſatisfaction of his luſts and paſſions, for the reverſion of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, who is perſwaded, there are ſeveral decrees paſt in Heaven as well to neceſſitate, as ſecure him in the Succedaneous injoyment of them both? And who will be frighted from the pleaſures of ſin with the threatned danger of damnation, (unleſs a fit of <hi>Melancholy</hi> tranſports him into that folly) which believes it is no more poſſible to happen to him, then for God to lie, or his immutable decrees to be reſcinded? In brief, when we conſider the conſequences of that doctrin, that the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute decrees of Heaven, do not only <hi>over-rule,</hi> but alſo <hi>predetermine</hi> every <hi>individual</hi> action of mankinde (ſo that 'tis impoſſible for the indeavours and wit of man, to make any one of them happen at any other time, or after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other manner then they do) may we not (as far as that doctrin can warrant us) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it is God's only fault, that ſo many men prove <hi>Infidels,</hi> and <hi>Profane, Lukewarm,</hi> and <hi>deſperate;</hi> becauſe it is <hi>he</hi> that doth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that grace, which is abſolutely neceſſary to work an effectual alteration and change in them? And reſolve, that it were therefore fit, that all preachers (forbearing to impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:116030:55"/> the weak creature to attempt any of thoſe mere impoſſibilities to which he hath, at moſt, but a paſſive power) ſhould direct their admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions to God alone, that he would (perform what is his own work onely, in the hearts of men, that is, to) <hi>Convert, Correct, provoke</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> them, by ſuch an <hi>invincible</hi> arme of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency as cannot be reſiſted?</p>
                     <p>The benefit of the word preached being thus totally evacuated by theſe doctrines, we ſhall find no more uſe or comfort in the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> but ſo far forth as we can obſerve, the very ſame <hi>Miniſters,</hi> in the very <hi>adminiſtration</hi> of them, to overthrow their own <hi>unhappy doctrin;</hi> for to <hi>every</hi> one they <hi>baptize,</hi> they apply the <hi>promiſes</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace, contrary to their own <hi>Tenet,</hi> which, that they belong no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all to the <hi>Reprobates.</hi> Likewiſe the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is given to all, with the aſſurance Chriſt died <hi>for all</hi> them that receive it, though their own <hi>Tenet</hi> is, that he no way died for them who receive it <hi>unworthily,</hi> and to their condemnation; whoſe number is not ſmall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our <hi>Reformed Congregations,</hi> even by their own Confeſſion.

                     <p>I conceive, the Miniſtery of the word hath theſe excellent titles beſtowed upon it, in regard it is the inſtrument, by and through which God doth infuſe into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and heart, his <hi>ſpecial grace,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that regenerating virtue, which <hi>alone</hi> doth powerfully effect the work of regeneration; ſo that the <hi>outward</hi> word, as an inſtrument, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth nothing at all, to that effect, but is onely as the <hi>tunnell,</hi> whereby water is poured into a veſſel; and yet that water receives no tincture at all from the nature or quality of the ſaid tunnell.</p>

                     <p>I have ſeen this alledged: But <hi>they ſay,</hi> we ſhould conſider, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and propertie of the <hi>word,</hi> is, to be intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible (in expreſsion) and to carry ſuch a ſenſe as is apt to move the party, to whom it is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:116030:58"/> by working upon his underſtanding, and inciting his heart to love or hatred, hope or fear; and this is the true efficacy the <hi>word</hi> is indowed with. But if the <hi>word</hi> contributes no more to our converſion or regeneration, than the <hi>tunnell</hi> (that only conveighs the liquor) to the filling of the veſſel: then it matters not whether the word be intelligible yea or no; for that regenerating virtue being a <hi>diſtinct</hi> power infuſed beſides <hi>it,</hi> the word doth not work as a <hi>verbal, id eſt,</hi> a <hi>rational</hi> inſtrument, but onely concurr's as an inſtrument deſtitute of ſenſe and reaſon. And therefore as it matters not what mettall the tunnell be made of, whether wood, or braſſe, or tinn; So (had the word no other kinde of inſtrumentalitie than that hath) it were all one, whether the language were barbarous <hi>non-ſenſe,</hi> (as is uſuall amongſt ſome Sectaries) or ſignificant. And to what end then did God confer the <hi>gift</hi> of tongues upon his Apoſtles, and they take ſuch care to condeſcend and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the capacitie and apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their hearers? Beſides, if the word hath no more to do in this work, than is pretended, why ſhould it conſiſt of precepts, and thoſe eſtabliſh't with promiſes and threatnings? For a precept, (ſo eſtabliſh'd eſpecially) doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the thing (under command) as a <hi>duty,</hi> and concurr's unto that duty, as the reaſon <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> and <hi>obliging</hi> a man to performe it; But
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:116030:59"/> if that ſpecial <hi>grace,</hi> or regenerating vertue, ſo infuſed, doth <hi>alone</hi> effect a mans regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (taking nothing at all from the word) how can that effect be ſaid to be the performance of his <hi>duty,</hi> and an act of <hi>obedience</hi> to the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of the word?</p>

                     <p>This doctrin doth cancel the very formal reaſon &amp; force of all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of Chriſt, and makes the word of God, intended for an inſtrument of mans converſion, to ſerve only for an <hi>object</hi> and meer doctrin for his faith and repentance to converſe with; (for they are not to be <hi>wrought</hi> (it ſeems) by this means, but <hi>immediately</hi> effected and wrought of Almighty God, in the heart, by a <hi>ſpecial</hi> action and operation) and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all the exhortations and precepts, as <hi>ſuch,</hi> all the promiſes and threatnings, complaints and obteſtations, wherewith the word of God
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:116030:59"/> aboundeth, to be nothing elſe, but <hi>empty ſigns,</hi> and <hi>buſie trifles</hi> (if not a ludicrous ſtage-play) conducing nothing to that effect, which they pretend to be deſigned for. But, that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>regeneration</hi> (which flowes from it,) are <hi>both</hi> wrought (in a rational way) by the outward miniſtery of the word, moving and inciting the underſtanding and heart of man, will evidently appear to be the doctrin of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. 1. For <hi>faith,</hi> take that expreſſion in our Saviours prayer, John 17. 17, 20. <hi>Sanctifie them through thy truth: thy word is truth. Neither pray I for theſe</hi> (Apoſtles) <hi>alone: but for them alſo, which ſhall believe on me through their word.</hi> See <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 31. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 13. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore faith commeth by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> 1. That he underſtands <hi>faith working by love,</hi> which the Goſpel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines to be the only means, by which we may, and ought to be ſaved, appears in the 9. and 10. verſes; <hi>If thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and believe with thy heart, that God raiſed him up from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteouſneſs, and with the tongue confeſſion is made unto ſalvation.</hi> 2. That by the <hi>word</hi> which works this <hi>faith,</hi> he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands the <hi>outward</hi> word, appears by the whol contexture of the Chapter; for he ſaith,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:116030:60"/> (1.) <hi>This is that word of faith, which we Preach,</hi> verſe 8. (2.) <hi>That word,</hi> which cannot be heard, <hi>unleſs it be preached,</hi> not <hi>internally</hi> by God, but <hi>externally</hi> by men, <hi>ſent out to that purpoſe,</hi> verſe 14, 15.

                     <p>As the working of faith is attributed to the miniſtery of the word, ſo is the working of <hi>Regeneration</hi> too; <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18, 19. <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let every man be ſwift to hear.</hi> To this adde 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23, 24, 25. <hi>Being born again not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever, and this is the word which by the Goſpel is preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you.</hi> Hereupon St. <hi>Paul</hi> tell's the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians,</hi> not only that he was a <hi>Min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

As long as he converſeth here below he is like other ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things, ſubject to change <note place="margin">Quod Angelis Caſus hominibus mors.</note> The reaſon is (beſides temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from without to allure and draw him) He hath a twofold principle, a <hi>new</hi> or an <hi>old</hi> man within him: the <hi>fleſh</hi> and the <hi>spirit</hi> in Con eſtation Gal. 5. 7. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the sp it, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh;</hi> This Conflict is in the <hi>regenerate;</hi> And that he hath liberty to ſide with either of theſe parties, and ſo to change, I think cannot be denied. He
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:116030:64"/> hath a liberty through Gods grace to ſide with the ſpirit againſt the fleſh; and hereupon he is exhorted <hi>to abstain from fleſhly luſts, to mortifie his earthly members, and to walk in the spirit;</hi> his liberty to ſide with the fleſh is but too evident. And therefore the words <hi>[CANNOT SIN]</hi> muſt be taken, not <hi>Phyſicè</hi> but <hi>Ethicè,</hi> Not for a natural impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency but a moral one, he cannot do it Legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or at averſeneſs of minde, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is capable of being altered.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:116030:65"/> may fall into ſuch ſins as leave them under a <hi>damnable guilt,</hi> ſo that they have need of <hi>an actual renuall of repentance,</hi> and <hi>a new abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> that they loſe their <hi>preſent aptneſſe to enter into the Kingdom of heaven, into which no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing ſhall enter.</hi> And that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> fell thus farr, will be evident, if you conſider the nature of their ſinnes, and apply theſe following Scriptures to them. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 9, 10. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 21. <hi>Apoc.</hi> 21. 7, 8. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3. 15. Now let us conſider whether it be not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man that is fall'n into this eſtate and condition, to be cut off in his ſins, before his repentance be renewed, and his new abſolution received, to remove his guilt, and reſtore him to an aptitude, and a preſent actuall capacity to enter into the kingdom of heaven. If it be poſſible for him to be cut off in this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then it will follow, that either he ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven at all; or elſe there muſt be ſome <hi>purgatory</hi> after this life (for him to paſſe thorow) to clenſe and fit him for heaven; which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not admit of. But if we ſay, it is not poſsible for ſuch a man to be cut off in his ſin; then it muſt follow, (1.) That he hath a leaſe of his life granted, till his reſtauration; which will be a hard matter to make appear; and (2) that God is bound by ſome Covenant or promiſe to afford him, as well grace as time to repent, and this will be as
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:116030:66"/> hard to evidence, as the former; for, I preſume, 'tis not to be denied, that there is required, a greater meaſure of grace to raiſe up ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner being fall'n, then to keep him while he ſtood, from falling; Now if God's <hi>Covenant and promiſe,</hi> did not binde him to give that leſs meaſure of grace to keep him actually from falling, how can we perſwade our ſelves that he is bound by it, to conferr that greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace, whereby he ſhall actually ariſe: Mr. <hi>Indefectible.</hi> The Apoſtle tell's the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, he is confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in them, will perform (or finiſh) it untill the day of Ieſus Chriſt.

                     <p>I need not ſay, the <hi>Apostle's</hi> perſwaſion is not alwayes an infallible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods purpoſe. <hi>[Act.</hi> 16. 6, 7.] for he had a perſwaſion of <hi>charitie,</hi> as well as of <hi>faith, [Heb.</hi> 6 9.] and that his perſwaſion touching the <hi>Philippians</hi> was of this nature, appeares by the verſe following, that which is alleaged.

                     <p>Sir, It will be a very hard matter to draw an argument from that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to infer your concluſion. <hi>The gifts and calling of God are without repentance,</hi> Ergo, <hi>what? The regenerate cannot fall from grace, and their interest in Gods favour?</hi> Which is a
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:116030:69"/> plain <hi>non ſequitur.</hi> It does not follow. For of whom ſpeaketh the Apoſtle that? Doth he not ſpeak it of the <hi>Iſraelites?</hi> And yet he tells you but ten verſes before, that <hi>they were bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off for their unbelief.</hi> All that can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from thoſe words will amount but to this, that God is ſo faithful and tenacious of his promiſe, (wherewith he had gratified their fathers) that (as 'tis verſe 23.) <hi>If they abide not ſtill in unbelief,</hi> he is no leſs willing and ready, than <hi>able to graft them into the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant again.</hi> And upon this occaſion, <hi>(my brethren,)</hi> give me leave to acquaint you with a few more of my <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>ſcruples,</hi> in order to my better ſatisfaction and ſettlement in theſe points; for I hope you will not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake me, as if I were <hi>peremptory</hi> in my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for I ſpeak only <hi>tentative,</hi> to trie, whether I can draw out of you, any better arguments or anſwers to objections, then I have hitherto met with, in thoſe that have handled theſe controverſies. I tell you then, that the <hi>Text</hi> laſt quoted with ſome other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the 9, 10, 11. Chapters of that Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> have begotten a great doubt in me; whether, the Apoſtle in his diſcourſe (Chapt. 9.) treateth at all, of that <hi>abſolute and peremptory decree</hi> of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> whereby men are <hi>irrevocably excluded from ſalvation, and all the neceſſary means that lead to it.</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:116030:69"/> Let me give you the reaſons of my doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                     <p>I am afraid we ſhall not have time now to examine them, yet ſeeing you are ſo deſirous, let us have them briefly, that we may be the better prepared to deliver our opinion about them at our next meeting.</p>

                     </speaker>
                     <p>Then take them thus. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it will be granted, that the Apoſtle, in thoſe Chapters applies his diſcourſe more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to the caſe of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet haply ſo, as to conclude all others in their example. If ſo, then, that he ſpeaks not of their <hi>abſolute and peremptory reprobation,</hi> is very probable, not only from his way of arguing, but alſo from his paſſionate ſorrow, hearty prayer, and earneſt exhortations to them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Let us reflect upon the Apoſtle's <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and his <hi>option</hi> upon it, Chap. 9. verſe 2, 3. <hi>I have great heavineſs and continual ſorrow in my heart. For I could wiſh that my ſelf were accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from Chriſt, for my brethren, my kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi> What is the ground of this heavineſs and his <hi>vote</hi> upon it? If it were that God, <hi>by an abſolute decree of reprobation, and out of his ſole beneplaciture had excluded them from the grace and power of believing unto righteouſneſs and ſalvation;</hi> (as ſome interpret it,) then, where was the <hi>pietie</hi> of the great Apoſtle expreſt in this <hi>ſorrow?</hi> Where was
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:116030:70"/> his <hi>prudence</hi> in this <hi>option?</hi> For if ſuch were the decree God, and the Apoſtle knew it, and was about to demonſtrate it to be ſuch, he muſt grant it to be <hi>moſt wiſe,</hi> and <hi>moſt juſt,</hi> and <hi>much conducing to the illustration of Gods glorie;</hi> and then 'twere <hi>impietie</hi> in any man (much more in him, who was therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a <hi>veſſel of Election,</hi> becauſe he was deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and called ſo eminently to be inſtrumental to the glory of the divine diſpenſations) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine and grieve at it. And if he knew ſuch a divine decree, to be <hi>immutably</hi> fixt to all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternitie; it was againſt <hi>prudence</hi> to interpoſe ſuch a wiſh for the avoidance of it. If the common opinion be true, that <hi>in reſpect of the manifeſtation of the divine glory, it is better and more Eligible</hi> to be <hi>miſerable</hi> than <hi>not to be at all,</hi> (and it be out of an <hi>erroneous</hi> and <hi>inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate judgement,</hi> that the very <hi>damned in hell-torments</hi> judge otherwiſe, as ſome great <hi>School-men</hi> maintain (then certainly we muſt ſet an ill Character upon the Apoſtles <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>option,</hi> if we make <hi>that</hi> the cauſe and ground of it alledged in this ſuppoſition. And it will not excuſe, to ſay this <hi>vote</hi> paſt the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> in the <hi>hurry</hi> of his paſſions, or that it was but a ſudden <hi>ſally</hi> of his affections, in their eager purſuit after the ſalvation of his nation; for all the circumſtances of the diſcourſe, and that ſolemn preface wherewith it is uſhered in,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:116030:70"/> do manifeſtly argue, that 'twas uttered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately, and with great deliberation. <hi>I ſay the truth in Chriſt, I lie not, my conſcience alſo bearing me witneſs in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Chap. 9. 1. and 'tis a ſufficient indication of his calm and compoſed minde, that he did commit this <hi>option</hi> to writing and tranſmit it in an Epiſtle to the Churches.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To this let us adde his prayer, Chap. 10. 1. <hi>Brethren my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might be ſaved.</hi> What <hi>Iſrael</hi> he means is expreſſed in the 3. verſe, <hi>they</hi> [who] <hi>being ignorant of God's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> went about <hi>to eſtabliſh their own righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> and did <hi>not ſubmit themſelves to the righteouſneſs of God.</hi> How can this prayer or option of the Apoſtle conſiſt with his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or belief of their <hi>abſolute and peremptory reprobation?</hi> For his prayer (according to that opinion) muſt be after this manner: <hi>Lord I know by Divine revelation, (and am now decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it, in an Epiſtle to the Romans, and ſo to all the world) that it is thine abſolute will and good pleaſure, utterly and irrevocably to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don this people under an immutable decree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; yet I do moſt heartily deſire, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, to grant that they may be ſaved.</hi> Such a prayer had been directly againſt his faith, and therefore <hi>ſin, (Rom.</hi> 14. 23.) and againſt the very <hi>Rule</hi> of prayer, and obedience
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:116030:71"/> in that kinde, <hi>[Thy will be done]</hi> and ſo ſin too. Sure the Apoſtle (after his converſion) was not wont, thus to break his faith and croſs the counſel of his maker.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. To this we may adde all other his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours and <hi>ſtratagems</hi> to gain them to the faith of Chriſt, and conſequently to ſalvation: of which we read, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 14. and elſe where. All which had been as ridiculous as the incounters of the <hi>Knight Errant. in Don Quixot,</hi> if the Apoſtle had believed theſe men to be abſolutely excluded, from all poſſibility of ſalvation, by ſuch a decree as ſome fancy to be treated of in that ninth Chapter.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. I conceive my doubt more reaſonable, when I conſider the Apoſtles way of arguing, <hi>[Rom.</hi> 11. 1.] For (to intimate (at leaſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my apprehenſion) that the ground of his ſorrow was, (not their <hi>abſolute irreſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive</hi> and <hi>irrevocable reprobation,</hi> but) the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of their <hi>rejection</hi> from the <hi>Covenant</hi> and divine grace, wherein they had hitherto ſtood, as God's peculiar adopted people) 1. He makes their <hi>own wilful unbelief,</hi> the cauſe and ground of this their <hi>rejection</hi> and miſerie, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 20. <hi>Becauſe of unbelief, they were broken off;</hi> which cannot be ſaid of the <hi>decree</hi> of <hi>Reprobation;</hi> for the <hi>maintainers</hi> of that decree, do not make unbelief the cauſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, but rather reprobation the cauſe of

Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo, ſimulando, ridendo.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Atqui apud Deum eſt luſus, &amp; ſi liceret ita dicere, mendacium eſt?</hi> Therefore <hi>Tilenus</hi> thought it an acceptable ſervice to God and good men, if he could offer any thing to clear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of that paſſage from the ſuſpicion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acceſſary to that doctrine in whoſe behalf 'tis ſo often pleaded. To this end let us examine the plea. Gen. 22. 2. <hi>God ſaid unto</hi> Abraham, <hi>Take now thy ſon, thine only ſon Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and get thee into the land of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riah: and offer him there for a burnt offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, upon one of the Mountains which I will tell thee of.</hi> (Where by the way the Reader may take notice that <hi>Abraham</hi> was to expect further orders from Almighty God before the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of this affair: But to the plea) here, ſay they, we have Gods <hi>revealed will</hi> ſignified by a command, that <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould be ſlain: But by his <hi>ſecret will,</hi> that he would not have it ſo, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as well by the event as by the Angels voice ver. 12. <hi>Lay not thine hand upon the Lad, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore God commands what he nilleth <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Tilenus</hi> ſees no ſuch matter, no contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no oppoſition betwixt Gods ſecret and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will in this paſſage, being confident to affirm that God willed with his ſecret will, all that was commanded by his revealed; which was, not the <hi>occiſion</hi> or <hi>ſlaughtering</hi> of <hi>Iſaac</hi> (to which
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:116030:132"/> ſingle act they uſually reſtrain Gods revelation and Command) but <hi>Abrahams</hi> voluntary and free obedience, in devoting, Conſecrating and rendring up his ſon for a ſacrifice at Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; ſome particulars whereof are ſet down, <hi>Take thy ſon, goe into the land of Moriah, carry wood and fire, make an Altar, and binde Iſaac and expoſe him upon it.</hi> That God will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this, is clear by the event according to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries own rule, <hi>Ex eventu judicandum eſt de Dei Voluntate.</hi> And that Gods command, or revealed will intended the ſame and no more, appears by all thoſe Scriptures, which (ſpeaking of this matter) do poſitively affirm, that <hi>Abraham,</hi> did fully perform what God had commanded. So Hebr. 11. 17. <hi>By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Iſaac: And he that had received the promiſes offered up his only ſon.</hi> So Jam. 2. 21. <hi>Was not Abraham our father juſtified by works when he had offered Iſaac his ſon upon the Altar?</hi> And ſo God himſelf interprets it, Gen. 22. 16. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt done this thing &amp;c.</hi> To which purpoſe alſo 'tis obſervable, that God does not uſe the ſame phraſe of speech in the Prohibition <hi>ver.</hi> 12. that he uſed in the injunction <hi>ver.</hi> 2. Here Gods will revealed is, <hi>offer eum in holocauſtum,</hi> but there the will of God forbidding is (not <hi>ne offeras;</hi> for that was done already according to Gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation and requiry, but) <hi>neinjicias manum tuam ſuper puerum.</hi>

                  <p> 
                     <hi>Objection.</hi> The phraſe and word of command in ordinary conſtruction ſeemed to imply the <hi>ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Iſaac; becauſe it was the cuſtome to ſlay ſuch ſacrifices before they were burnt upon the altar.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> For anſwer to this, it needs not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, that words and phraſes in Holy Scripture (as well as in other authors) are uſed in diverſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: but the anſwer is, that there was a neceſſitie (upon the matter) that Almighty God ſhould uſe a phraſe that carried ſuch an obvious ſenſe with it, becauſe this was a ſpecial command gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto <hi>Abraham</hi> for a ſignal trial of his faith and obedience, <hi>[And it came to paſs that God did tempt Abraham</hi> Gen. 22. 1.] which there could have been no proof of, if God had expounded to him the ſenſe of his command after this manner, <hi>Go, take thy ſon, &amp;c. but thou needeſt not ſtartle at the impoſition, for my intent and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is, only that thou ſhouldeſt bring him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the land of</hi> Moriah, <hi>and blinde him and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him there upon the altar, which thou ſhalt make for that purpoſe, and then I will accept thy obedience, and reſcue thy ſon from the knife by a voice from Heaven.</hi> If God had thus far revealed his will, <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith had found no difficultie to conteſt againſt, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently had not been capable of an approbation. The upſhot therefore of all is this, that in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with <hi>Abraham,</hi> God revealed his will,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:116030:133"/> and nothing but his will, but not his whole will, which he was not bound to do, neither could the doing of it conſist with his deſign of trying the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of <hi>Abrahams</hi> graces. But this is not to be drawn into example, when we ſpeak of Gods ordinary external intercourſe with ſinners invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and calling them to repent, believe and obey the Gospel, upon promiſe of life and peril of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                  <p>For 1. This would make the divine call, not only a continual temptation (which is abſurd e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough) but alſo ridiculous; for this would not be ſuch a temptation, as that which occurs in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> example; wherein the duty command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was not only poſſible to be performed, but was alſo actually performed, ſo far forth, that God declared his own ſatisfaction in it by a voice from Heaven. But (according to the doctrin of thoſe men we oppoſe) God is ſuppoſed to be alwayes tempting and trying, whether that will come to paſs, which is altogether impoſſible to come to paſs, that is, he tempts and tries again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, whether the reprobate will believe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, that is, whether he will do that, which Gods own decree hath rendred impoſſible for him to do. Which is, as if one ſhould be very ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous to make an experiment, whether the blinde would ſee, or the dead walk. 2. This would make Gods calling of Reprobates, which is done by his <hi>ſignant</hi> will alone; (as they ſay) not only
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:116030:133"/> an act of hypocriſie, in ſeeming to wiſh them well, by deſiring their repentance and ſalvation, when his <hi>beneplacent</hi> will hath decreed otherwiſe: but alſo an act of cruelty; becauſe by this calling, God is not only the occaſion, or cauſe of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie and diſobedience (it being impoſſible for reprobates to anſwer that call) but of their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er puniſhment likewiſe, into which they do neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily fall for that their neceſſary and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able infidelitie. From which it follows. 3. That that will whereby God wills not to give to reprobates ſufficient grace to inable them to repent and believe (much leſs irreſiſtible grace, that actually they muſt do ſo) ſhould not be <hi>Voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> but rather <hi>Maleplaciti,</hi> a will of diſpleaſure rather then of good pleaſure; becauſe it is an affection of the greateſt hatred and averſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; where as notwithſtanding Gods calling unto faith and to ſalvation (which is done by the word) is declared to be an act of his <hi>good pleaſure and grace, [Epheſ.</hi> 1. 9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 11. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9.] and an evidence of his <hi>compaſſion</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> as may eaſily be collected out of Holy Scripture. [2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36. 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 7. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. 15.] Laſtly, according to the doctrin of that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and thoſe men that make uſe of it, the whole revelation and miniſtery of the Goſpel, goes for no more, but <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> the will of God to give out ſuch a thing for a ſigne only, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, it is the will of Gods <hi>beneplaciture</hi> and
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:116030:134"/> is expreſly ſo called, as ſhall appear in the ſecond particular, wherein <hi>Tilenus</hi> offers the Reader ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which is, about the ſenſe of another text perverſly cited by him above upon another oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>

                     <hi>Maccovius [Colleg. de Predeſt. diſp.</hi> 2.] to prove that God would not have all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; no, not <hi>[voluntate ſigni]</hi> contrary to the moſt expreſs grammatical ſenſe of Scripture [1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9.] he ſaith, <hi>voluntas ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni, non eſt propriè dicta voluntas, ſed eſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bum Dei,</hi> that which is revealed and ſignified (in holy Scripture) to be the minde of God, is not his will properly ſo called, but it is the word of God, (as if it were conſiſtent with his ſacred veracitie to utter ſomething diſagreeable to his own will) and he affirms further <hi>[diſp.</hi> 5.] that God doth not will, that is, not delight in or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of any thing, but what he doth effect, and this he indeavours to prove out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. 3. a paralel place to which, we have <hi>Pſalm</hi> 135. 6. againſt which doctrin theſe 2. aſſertions are clear.</p>
                  <p>1. That Gods word or his command revealed in holy Scripture, is his <hi>will</hi> properly ſo called. <hi>John</hi> 6. 38, 39, 40. <hi>I came down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—to do the will of him that ſent me—and this is the will of him that ſent me.</hi> Rom. 2. 18. <hi>Thou art called a Jew—and makeſt thy boaſt of God, and knoweſt his will—being inſtructed out of the law.</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 3. <hi>This</hi>

                     <hi>is the will of God even your ſanctification.</hi> Mat. 7. 21. <hi>But he that doth the will of my father, &amp;c. See</hi> Mat. 12. 50. John 7. 17. chap. 9. 31. Heb. 13. 21. 1 John 2. 17. 'Tis that which is right in the eyes of the Lord. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 17, 18. &amp; <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 21.

And if it be not ſo, how can we be aſſured, that we do pleaſe him, and are acceptable in his ſight, when we walk according to this rule?</p>
                  <p>2. This will of God is not alwayes done, but many times the contrary. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 12. <hi>&amp; chap.</hi> 66. 4.

                  <p>Now to come to thoſe paſſages of the Plalmiſt; when he ſaith, <hi>The Lord doth whatſoever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth him,</hi> it cannot be underſtood of mans work, whether we mean his <hi>ſin</hi> or his <hi>duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. Not of his ſin; for that cannot be ſaid to pleaſe God. <hi>For he is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs.</hi> Pſal. 5. 4. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moſt of our adverſaries are aſhamed, direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attribute the effecting thereof unto God. Nor yet 2. Can it be underſtood of mans <hi>duty;</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:116030:135"/> for that pleaſeth God, not as it is <hi>opus operatum [Iſa.</hi> 1, 12. <hi>&amp;c.]</hi> but as it is a <hi>duty,</hi> and a duty it cannot be, if it be Gods doing; for a duty is a work performed by an inferiour, in obedience to the command of his ſuperiour, who hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie over him; and conſequently mans duty cannot be a work of Gods only doing: beſides, he that commands a thing, he would have that thing, which he commands, to be done by him, to whom he doth command it: but he that does that thing (ſuppoſed to be under command) himſelf, he wills not that it be done by another: otherwiſe he ſhould at the ſame time both will and nill it to be done by that other. The Pſalmiſt therefore is to be underſtood, not of the things, which the Lord would have done (in a way of duty) by others; nor yet of ſuch things as he promiſes to perform himſelf upon condition of mans obedience, which through default hereof many times are not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 30. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 30.) but of all things, which he intends abſolutely to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute and bring to paſs himſelf (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33. 9.) and ſo we may obſerve, that his power in theſe works, is oppoſed to the impotencie of Idols, who are able to do juſt nothing: ſee thoſe two Pſalms throughout, <hi>viz.

                  </p>
                  <p>But here a queſtion may be moved, whether the will of God can at any time be defeated? To which the anſwer is, that 'tis moſt true in a good ſenſe, that the will of God is alwayes fulfilled.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:116030:135"/> For the underſtanding whereof we muſt diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of Gods will and the objects of it. Some things God wills <hi>Abſolutely,</hi> and they muſt of <hi>neceſſity</hi> come to paſs, otherwiſe, that will of God could not be truly ſaid to be fulfilled. Thus when 'tis ſaid, God <hi>will</hi> give Chriſt for a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the people; Whoremongers and Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers God <hi>will</hi> judge, the faithful he <hi>will</hi> ſave; if Chriſt were not ſo given, or Whoremungers and Adulterers could avoid judgment, or the faithful fail of ſalvation, Gods will declared in thoſe promiſes and threatnings, were utterly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Thus alſo, it being Gods <hi>abſolute</hi> will, that man being a reaſonable creature, ſhould be a <hi>Free Agent,</hi> he muſt be ſo of <hi>neceſſity.</hi> Other things God wills <hi>disjunctively,</hi> and they come to paſs <hi>contingently,</hi> or not at all; otherwiſe if they ſhould come to paſs of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> Gods will ſhould be croſt in them. For in theſe things his will is, that neither the one, nor the other particular ſhould be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but either that they ſhould not be at all, or be <hi>Contingent.</hi> This diſtinction may be ſeen in his judgment threatned and propounded to David 2 Sam. 24. 12, 13. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I offer thee three things, chuſe which of them I ſhall do unto thee. Wilt thou that ſeven years of famine come upon the land, or wilt thou flee three moneths before thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or that there be three dayes of peſtilence in thy land.</hi> Here God <hi>abſolutely</hi> will'd to ſend
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:116030:136"/> a judgment, and conſequently the coming of it was <hi>neceſſary:</hi> but which of the three was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Davids <hi>choice,</hi> and ſo that was <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</hi> But this diſtinction is more evident in Gods commands, eſtabliſh't with promiſes and threatnings, relating to mans tranſgreſſion and obedience reſpectively. So in his commands for temporal ſafety. Jer. 21. 8, 9. <hi>And unto this people thou ſhalt ſay, Thus ſaith the Lord, Behold I ſet before you the way of life, and the way of death. He that abideth in this city ſhall die by the ſword, and by the famine, and by the peſtilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Caldeans, that beſiege you, he ſhall live, and his life ſhall be unto him for a prey.</hi> Here Gods will is <hi>disjunctive,</hi> and whether they continued in the city, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh't there, or fled out to the <hi>Caldeans</hi> and were preſerved by them, it was a matter of their own free choiſe, and ſo <hi>Contingent;</hi> but which ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of theſe two courſes they took and ſucceeded accordingly, Gods will was fulfilled. So it is likewiſe in the matter of life and death eternal. Deut. 11. 26, 27, 28. <hi>Behold, I ſet before you this day, a bleſſing and a curſe: A bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, if ye obey the Commandments of the Lord your God: And a curſe if ye will not obey, but turn aſide out of the way, which I command you, and</hi> Rom. 8. 13. <hi>If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die: but if ye through</hi>
                     <pb n="245" facs="tcp:116030:136"/> 
                     <hi>the ſpirit, do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> So that whether they live by one means, or die by the other, Gods will is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fulfilled; becauſe his will is not that they ſhall either neceſſarily obſerve his commands, or neceſſarily tranſgreſs them: But if they doe tranſgreſs (though that tranſgreſſion be <hi>Contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> Death is the neceſſary Doom awarded to it. And if they do obſerve them though that obſervation be a matter of choiſe and ſo <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> alſo, yet is life the neceſſary Reward, and abſolutely deſigned to crown that obedience.</p>
                  <p>It appears by this diſcourſe, that God cannot fail of accompliſhing ſuch an end, and after ſuch a manner as his wiſdome thinks fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound in his intercourſe with voluntary and free Agents; for if he cannot prevail with us (by ſuch means, and ſuch a manner of working as is agreeable to the condition of our intellectual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to ſuffer our ſelves to be ſaved by him, in performing that ſervice to which his goodneſs hath ordained us (which his good pleaſure is ſet upon in the firſt place) then his good pleaſure is fulfilled by inflicting upon us that puniſhment, which he treatned; according to that ſaying of <hi>S.</hi> Auguſtine, <hi>Facit Deus Voluntatem ſuam de eo, à quo voluntas ejus facta non eſt.</hi>
